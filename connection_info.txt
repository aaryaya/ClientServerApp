Connection Information

## Server Details
- IP Address:<Your server IP address>
- Port:6000
- Startup Instructions:
  - Ensure that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed.
  - Compile the `Server.java` file.
  - Run the server using the command: `java Server`.
  - Ensure that the port `6000` is open on the firewall if applicable.
  - The server can accommodate multiple clients, with one being designated as the coordinator.

## Client Details
- Client ID: Each client must have a unique ID.
- Server IP Address: Clients must know the server's IP address.
- Port: 6000
- Connection Instructions:
  - Ensure the JDK is installed on the client machine.
  - Compile the `client.java` file.
  - Run the client using the command: `java client`.
  - Provide the server's IP address and port (6000) when prompted.
  - Enter a unique client ID when prompted.
  - Clients can communicate with the server and other connected clients via broadcast or private messages.

## Commands
- /quit: Disconnects the client from the server.
- @<clientId> <message>: Sends a private message to the client with the specified `clientId`.
- /memberdetails (Coordinator only): Retrieves details about all connected clients, including their IP addresses and ports.

## Network Setup
- Ensure that both server and clients are on the same local network, or configure port forwarding if clients connect from a different network.
- If accessing the server remotely, make sure the server IP is public and accessible to clients.
- Port forwarding or NAT traversal may be necessary if using the system over the internet.

## Security Information
- No encryption is implemented in this basic setup. If security is a concern, consider adding SSL/TLS for encrypted communication.
- Clients and the server authenticate only through client IDs, so ensure IDs are unique to prevent conflicts.

## Troubleshooting
- Client can't connect to server:
  - Verify that the server is running and the correct IP address and port are provided.
  - Ensure that the firewall is not blocking the connection on port `6000`.
- Client disconnects abruptly:
  - The server will attempt to handle abrupt client disconnections, but if persistent issues arise, check the network stability.
